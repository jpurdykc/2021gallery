<h3>The Student Show is an annual exhibit displayed in the Lightner Library, but due to COVID restrictions, we were unable to host an exhibit in the year 2019-2020.  It was a tough year for everyone, and art students still had to find a way to be creative and produce work for classes that were no longer face-to-face.  We all learned to adapt in the best way we could and that was to persevere and move forward. </h3>

<br>

<h3>This spring 2021 art show is a showcase featured online only, to peruse at your own leisure. The collection features some of the best work produced by art students or by students choosing to take an art class as an elective. Each project featured took about two weeks and is from the following subjects: Drawing, Painting, Foundational Design, Graphic Design, Video Production, Photography, Mixed Media, Ceramics-Sculpture, and Advanced Studies. We are proud to share these works with our community and we welcome any feedback, comments, or interest in purchasing works.</h3>

<h3>We thank you for your time in reviewing our work and supporting our creative endeavors in the Art and Design program!</h3>
